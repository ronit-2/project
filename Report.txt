1) Encapsulation
	Encapsulaion, or data hiding, is the process where certain variables 
	in a class will be hidden from another class, and only can be 
	aquired through methods of present class.
	
	Advantages:
	- Class has full control of stored data, which maintains data security
	Disadvantages:
	- Data is not easily accesible by other units for modification
	
	Programs: GetEncap.java & RunEncap.java
	
2) Inheritance
	When one class gains the abilities and resources from another class
	with the keyword extends followed after the class.
	
	Advantages:
	- Less coding required 
	Disadvantages:
	- Not flexible, can not be altered at runtime
	- Unessecary information can be transferred 
	
	Programs: SubMath.java

3) Polymorphism 
	Polymorphism is a word meaning many forms of something. The process 
	is taken into action when a method is overridden or overloaded. 
	
	Compile-Time Polymorphism:
	The overriden method is resolved at compile-time rather than at
	run-time. The object is refrenced by a base class type instead of
	being futhur derived. 
	
	Run-Time Polymorphism:
	The overriden method is resolved at run-time rather than at 
	compile-time. An overriden method is called through a refrenced variable
	in the superclass. 
	
	Advantages:
	- Helps re-use code 
	
	Disadvantages:
	- difficult to actually impliment in code 
	
	Programs: Swim.java & Shopping.java
	
4) Abstraction
	Abstraction is the process of hiding details and information that 
	is not relevant to the user. For example, an email. You would use an 
	Abstract class to cover the complex details of what happened right 
	after that email was delievered to the recipient. 
	
	Advantages:
	- Create a funcitoning class which other subclasses can easily override
	Disadvantages:
	- Lengthy and requires precision
	
	Prorgams: Order.java
